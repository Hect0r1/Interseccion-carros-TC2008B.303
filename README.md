# Interseccion-carros-TC2008B.303

Project made with Unity and mainly the Python library AgentPy, this work basically consists of making an intersection simulation, where the position of every car is calculated using a Python script where the main library used is AgentPy, this code execution is done in a local flask server and then the positions of this cars are sent to the Unity project where the simulation of the cars moving in the intersection can be seen.

A demo of the car intersection simulation on AgentPy: https://youtu.be/zQjMJPEdppc
